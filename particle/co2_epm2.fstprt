# Harmonic angle potential is k(theta - theta_0)^2, without the 1/2 factor (see AngleHarmonic).
# The original manuscript reports drawing from an angle distribution with probability
#
# P(theta) = exp[-0.5 beta kappa (theta - theta_0)]
#
# in the fourth paragraph of the manuscript.
# The correct distribution should have been
#
# P(theta) = sin(theta)*exp[-0.5 beta kappa (theta - theta_0)]
#
# Because for k=0, P(theta) = sin(theta) for random point picking on the surface of a unit sphere.
# The reported distribution leads to unphysical bias toward the poles (theta 0 and pi).
# It is possible this was a typo in the manuscript.
# It is also possible this may have led other researchers to implement a rigid version of EPM2, because the
# bias toward the poles makes the bond more stiff than if the sin(theta) term was included.
