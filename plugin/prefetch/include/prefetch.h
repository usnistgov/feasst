/**
  Farm a trial to each processor, then reconstruct the serial Markov chain.

  Although its quite a simple strategy, the trickiest part is efficiently
  reproducing the accepted perturbation on all threads (e.g., the synchronizing
  step) in a way that's general to all MC trials (and potential functions/
  optimizations).
  This can get really complicated by cell lists, neighbor lists and k-space.
  For the synchronize step, I've used two different strategies, sometimes both
  at the same time, which span the range of ease of implementation vs efficiency.

  1. Cache every random number and energy term generated during the trial, and
  if that trial is the accepted one, revert the others, then feed those cached
  RNG/energies back to the other threads to reproduce the same perturbations.
  There are some issues with FEASST here because the energy calcs are also part
  of the neighbor/cell/kvector updates.
  Also, this means going through each config bias step, etc, so its not the most
  efficient synchronization possible.

  2. A more efficient synchronization method is to give objects a synchronize
  method which takes as input a reference to the base class its trying to copy
  and the list of particles/sites that were changed in the trial.
  For example, in Ewald, VisitModel is the base class of Ewald, and Select has
  the list of particles/sites that were perturbed.
  The base class also needs a data structure (SynchronizeData) that all the
  derived classes use.
  In the most complex cases, the data is separated between ones that are
  automatically copied every time, or ones manually choosen based on which
  sites were perturbed.

  Prefetch is not used for the until_num_particles argument in Run.

      to give erroneous results.
