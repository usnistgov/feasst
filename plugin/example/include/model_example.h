  Add a model to FEASST by using this file as a template and instruction set.
  Follow the same steps detailed in /feasst/plugin/example/README.rst.
  In summary, copy model_example.[h/cpp] to new_name.[h/cpp], replace
  ModelExample with NewName, then replace MODEL_EXAMPLE with NEW_NAME.

  In some cases, TablePotential may be a more convenient and efficient approach
  to implementing a custom potential in FEASST.

  For more inspiration, take a look at other existing ModelTwoBody, such as
  LennardJones or LennardJonesCutShift, or the models plugin.
  Sometimes it is easiest to find an existing model that is the more similar to
  what you need, and copy/rename those files instead.

\rst
As an example, consider the Jagla model,\ :footcite:p:`jagla_core-softened_1999`
but with the variables renamed as follows:
:math:`\epsilon_1 \rightarrow \gamma`,
:math:`\epsilon_2 \rightarrow \epsilon`,
:math:`\lambda_1 \rightarrow \lambda`,
:math:`\lambda_2 \rightarrow r_c`.

.. math::

    U(r) = \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \infty & : r < \sigma, \\
        \frac{\gamma(\lambda - r)-\epsilon(r-\sigma)}{\lambda-\sigma} & : \sigma \le r \le \lambda, \\
        -\frac{\epsilon(r_c - r)}{r_c-\lambda} & : \lambda \le r \le r_c, \\
        0 & : r \ge r_c.
      \end{array}
    \right.

In some studies, the continuous linear ramp has been converted into a number of
discrete steps to enable simulations with discontinuous molecular dynamics.
For example, see Fig. 1(d) of :footcite:t:`de_haro_structural_2018`
