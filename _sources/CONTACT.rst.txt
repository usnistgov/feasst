Bug reporting
**************

Any and all bug reports are greatly appreciated in order to improve FEASST.

The following checklist is recommended to improve reproducibility so that I can get back to you more quickly.

* Reproduce the issue with a minimal example to reduce the complexity, run time and file size.
* Provide all output.
* Provide the version (for a git install, bash command "git describe --abbrev=10 --dirty --always --tags" and commit from git log).
* Provide the user code (e.g., input text file, C++ with int main() or .py file).
* For installation errors, include the output of the "cmake .." command on an empty build directory.
