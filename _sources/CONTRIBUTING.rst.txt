Guidelines for collaboration with FEASST developers
-------------------------------------------------------

FEASST developers appreciate collaboration with other scientists.
Some general collaboration guidelines are listed below.
These may be further refined on a case-by-case basis.

* Collaborators intend to publish with developers while users do not.
* Collaborators may have extensive private conversations with developers.
* User questions are preferred in public mail lists or GitHub issues (see `Contact <CONTACT.html>`_).
* Feature requests involving collaboration implicitly have priority due to common interest.
* Former collaborators may become users and *vice versa*. Future private FEASST-related communication with developers should indicate this change of role.
