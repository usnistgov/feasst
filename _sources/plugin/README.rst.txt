***************************
C++ Interface
***************************

C++ classes are organized as follows.
The random number generate is set by :cpp:class:`Random <feasst::Random>`.
:cpp:class:`Configuration <feasst::Configuration>` contains the identity and positions of particles, sites and the spatial :cpp:class:`Domain <feasst::Domain>`.
:cpp:class:`Model <feasst::Model>` computes the potential energy between two sites.
To find all available :cpp:class:`Models <feasst::Model>`, look at the subclasses in the documentation for :cpp:class:`one <feasst::ModelOneBody>` or :cpp:class:`two <feasst::ModelTwoBody>` body Models.
:cpp:class:`VisitModel <feasst::VisitModel>` loops a :cpp:class:`Model <feasst::Model>` over all selected particles and sites, or contains a many-body potential such as :cpp:class:`LongRangeCorrections <feasst::LongRangeCorrections>` or :cpp:class:`Ewald <feasst::Ewald>`.
:cpp:class:`Potential <feasst::Potential>` contains both :cpp:class:`Model <feasst::Model>` and :cpp:class:`VisitModel <feasst::VisitModel>`.
:cpp:class:`Trial <feasst::Trial>` is a :cpp:class:`MonteCarlo <feasst::MonteCarlo>` trial move.
:cpp:class:`Criteria <feasst::Criteria>` determine if the :cpp:class:`Trial <feasst::Trial>` is accepted or rejected.
:cpp:class:`FlatHistogram <feasst::FlatHistogram>` methods :cpp:class:`Bias <feasst::Bias>` along a :cpp:class:`Macrostate <feasst::Macrostate>`.
:cpp:class:`Analyze <feasst::Analyze>` and :cpp:class:`Modify <feasst::Modify>` occur every fixed number of :cpp:class:`Trials <feasst::Trial>`, but an :cpp:class:`Action <feasst::Action>` happens only once.
These base classes have all their subclasses listed in their respective documentation.

The C++ interface is organized by plugins.
A FEASST plugin is a collection of related classes.
Unnecessary plugins can be removed from the FEASST_PLUGINS variable in /path/to/feasst/CMakeLists.txt.
Similarly, plugins can also be added this way.
In both cases, FEASST must be reinstalled.

The recommended approach for finding more information on a class is demonstrated as follows.
If you would like more information on `RandomMT19937 <plugin/math/doc/RandomMT19937.html>`_ but are not sure where to find it, you could search headers files

.. code-block:: bash

   grep -r --include=*.h RandomMT19937

And find that the class is part of the `Math <plugin/math/README.html>`_ plugin.

See the example plugin as a template for creating your own class or plugin.

The plugins and classes listed below represent all the publicly available capabilities of FEASST.
