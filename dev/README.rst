Developer guidelines
***************************

Developers and contributors of FEASST may consider the following guidelines in order to simplify collaboration.

Branch policies
=======================

Branches in Git are extremely useful for working on different features within the same code base and then merging them into a final product or release.

Using and naming branches in a way that is consistent may simplify this process.

Main branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the release branch.
This branch may only merge with develop and hotfix branches.

* `GTEST: Unittest C++`_ and all tests pass
* `Valgrind: Find memory leaks`_
* `GCOV and LCOV: Test coverage`_ which must be >85%
* `cpplint and pylint: Clean up styling`_
* SWIG and Python unittested
* `Document`_ new features
* Tag :code:`git tag -a <version number>` and :code:`git push --tags`

Develop branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the development branch.

Tested and complete implementation of new features are added here.

* Code must compile and gtests pass successfully
* Consider feature compatibility with swig python interface
* When merging into this branch, use --squash to add the entire feature with a single commit.
  Alternatively, you could also rebase your private branch.

Hotfix branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hotfix branch is for implementation of bug fixes to the main branch.
After merging with main and develop, they are deleted.

Feature branches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These branches are for the development of new features.
These branch names must begin with characters which identify the main developer of the feature (e..g, username/feature)
The main developer sets the branch policy.

Dead (dead_*) branches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These branches may record an incomplete attempt of a feature that may be relevant in the future.
These branch names must begin with the characters "dead".

* No rules. Code may not compile.
  HINT: rename branches with "git branch -m <newname>"

Pull requests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a pull request:

* fork the usnistgov repo
* create a new feature branch "user/feature" to implement your changes (git checkout develop; git checkout -b user/feature)
* make as many commits as you want for yourself, which will be squashed into one commit when you're finished as follows
* when your feature is ready and well tested and you're ready to submit a pull request, first you can check if any more changes were made to develop (git checkout develop; git pull usnistgov develop; git checkout user/feature; git merge develop)
* squash your commits into a new branch "testmerge" off develop (git checkout develop; git checkout -b testmerge; git merge --squash user/feature)
* submit the "testmerge" branch in the pull request.
* You can keep your "user/feature" branch with more fine-grain commits for your own purposes or later testing if an issue is discovered. I often rename these "complete_feature" after merging to develop.

Try to copy the style of existing commits in the main branch. This means reducing the number of commits in a pull request (e.g., consider a git merge), and to keep the commit descriptions in a similar style as existing commits. For example, the description should be a single sentence that is general and not redundant information from what you see when you click on the details of the commit. Basically, the commit description should be a single line and very succinct (e.g., the classes or plugins changed).

For lead developers to incorporate the pull request into feasst
- git fetch usnistgov pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME
- git checkout BRANCHNAME
- [make local changes. Can "git commit --amend"]
- If authorship is missing after a squash merge, use git commit --amend --author="My Nick my.adress@email.com"
- git push usnistgov BRANCHNAME

Tools
================================================================================

GTEST: Unittest C++
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main branch requires GTEST coverage for all cpp plugins in plugin/name/test.

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DUSE_GTEST=ON ..
    make unittest -j12
    ./bin/unittest

* use :code:`--gtest_filter=*Name*` to run specific tests
* use :code:`./bin/unittest \|& more` to pipe stderr to stdout.
* use :code:`--gtest_shuffle` to randomize the order of the tests
* use :code:`--gtest_random_seed=SEED` to reproduce an specific order.

GDB or LLDB: Debugging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

gdb (or lldb on macOS) is especially useful for identifying segfaults via backtraces.
The -g flag in compilation pulls the symbols so that you can get correct line numbers in the gdb output.
Often, the optimization flags (e.g., -O3) can obfuscate the backtrace.
If that is the case, recompile without optimization (using cmake).

In bash

.. code-block:: bash

   gdb [program executable name]
   r [flags]

or

.. code-block:: bash

   gdb --batch --command=../dev/test.gdb ./bin/unittest


gdb can also be used with python as

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/feasst/build/
   gdb python
   r [python script] [optional flags]

* use 'gdb catch throw' or 'lldb break set -E C++' to backtrace exceptions

* use gdb as a profiler by ctrl c in the middle and backtrace: https://stackoverflow.com/a/378024
* use gdb as a parallel profiler: http://poormansprofiler.org/

Valgrind: Find memory leaks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valgrind helps to detect memory management bugs.

http://valgrind.org/

For example, to run Valgrind on a particular test and output to text file

.. code-block:: bash

   valgrind ./unittest --gtest_filter=MC.* > out.txt 2>&1

* For uninitialized value errors, try --track-origins=yes
* For leaks, try --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all
* Don't use profiler for leak checks. OMP causes "leaks" O.K.
* For suppress false-positives (e.g., gomp or gsl), use --gen-suppressions=all to generate suppression files

GCOV and LCOV: Test coverage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GCC compilers allow testing of coverage with gcov and lcov for visualization.

* Code: currently implemented with Travis CI and CodeCov and available online.
  See .travis.yml for example of how to use lcov
* Use GCOV with CMake: cmake -DUSE_GCOV .
  Note: this disables optimization, so don't use it for production simulations.
* make coverage
* Open coverage/index.html in your browser.
* Go into "src" and ignore the external library coverage.

CCACHE: Speed up compilation time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Something as trivial as changing a comment in a header file can lead to a massive recompile of the entire source.
Your previous compile is remembered by ccache, leading to near instant recompilation in the above example.

cpplint and pylint: Clean up styling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pip notes
-------------------------

dev/tools/pip_install.sh

Style
================================================================================

Reference guides for C++
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* http://www.cplusplus.com/
* https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
* http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines

Naming
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ClassNames are mixed case with starting upper case letter
* member_names are lower case with underscores
* private_member_names\_ end with an underscore
* function_names are also lower case with underscores
* bools syntax: is_[accepted.., etc]
* MACROS and CONSTANTS are all upper case.
* Avoid MACROS and CONSTANTS.
* use "and", "or" instead of "&&", "||" (HWH: change this to follow Google?)

Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use return values. Argument ordering: input (value or constant reference), then output (pointer only)
* Overloaded functions -> can you document all in a single comment? good
* No Default parameters on virtual functions

Classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Nearly all data members should be private. Limit protected members
* member_name() returns const member
* set_member_name(member_name) sets member
* For setters with multiple arguments, the first are vector indices as in order x[0] = 3...
* getptr_member_name returns constant pointer (optimization only)

Loops and if
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* use of "for (auto element : container) { ... }" is dangerous
* for simple loops over containers, use "for (element : container)"
* for loops where you need the index, use:
  for (int index = 0; index < static_cast<int>(container.size()); ++index)

Auto
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* only use auto when the type is clear such as auto var = std::make_shared<..>.

Arguments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* All arguments are provided as strings and converted to the expected type.
* Check that all arguments are used (e.g., like implicit none, a typo is caught).
* Argument defaults need to be set and clearly commented.
* If no default, it is a required argument.

Serialization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* guided by https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/serialization
* For inheritance hierarchy, a static deserialize_map is used to relate class
  name to template.
* Each object serializes a version that can be used for checks and backwards
  compatibility.
* utils_io.h contains many function templates for serialization.
* In particular, feasst_deserialize_fstdr() needs to be fixed.
* Don't forget to serialize (private) member data in new implementations.
* To compare differences between two serializations, paste into file and using "s/ /\r/g"

File output
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* comma-separated values (CSV) are the preferred format (e.g., comma deliminter)

For quick reference
================================================================================

* line counts [find . -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.h' | xargs wc -l | sort -n]
* tutorial errors [ find . -name 'tutorial_failures.txt' | xargs cat ]
* tutorial errors [ for fl in `find . -name 'tutorial_failures.txt'`; do echo $fl; cat $fl; done ]
* launch errors [ for fl in `find . -name 'launch_failures.txt'`; do echo $fl; cat $fl | grep -v "Terminating because Checkpoint"; done ]
* clear tutorial errors [ for fl in `find . -name 'tutorial_failures.txt'`; do echo $fl; rm $fl; done ]
* clean docs before running depend.py again [ for dir in `ls --color=never -d *`; do rm $dir/doc/*rst; done ]
* screen html errors [ make html > tt 2&>1; grep -v "WARNING: document i" tt | grep -v "WARNING: Duplicate" | grep -v "Declaration is" > ttt ]
* find all headers in the public interface [ find . -name '*.h' | xargs grep "^  \/\*\* \@name Arguments$" ]
* find difference in serialization string: [ diff -u f1 f2 |colordiff  | perl /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/diff-highlight/diff-highlight | more ]

To Do List
================================================================================

* profile: Create benchmarking profile to compare among versions
* profile: implement timer for profiles (with hierarchies by class... tried this, but its too slow. Time only infrequently?)
* profile: implement a timer to auto-balance trial weights based on cpu time.
* debug: Toggle more debug levels, and localized to certain files/plugins, etc
* debug: Implement a class-specific debug output setting
* compile: fix dependency linkers required by clang/cmake on macOS but not g++ on ubuntu
* opt: when selecting from cpdf, use lnp instead of p?
* force precompute when reinitializing system, criteria, etc in MonteCarlo
* MonteCarlo subclass Simulation
* add citations to tutorials (reweighting, etc) and also citation suggestions for MC objects
* VisitModels may prefer to update select properties (e.g., cell, eik)
* Rename TrialSelect->SelectTrial, TrialCompute->ComputeTrial. Rename Compute->Decide?.
* Somehow, trial_growth_expanded.h doesn't include debug.h but can compile with ASSERT
* Speed up RNG by maintaining int_distribution like dis_double
* Make a CachedRandom and CachedPotential for prefetch and avoid if statements that could slow down serial simulations.
* add orientation argument to shapes with internal coordinate transformation
* Sort selection_of_all, or impose sorting in Select::add_particles. Currently, this leads to issues.
* Rename xyz files, and/or document more cleary (second line in xyz).
* Rename plugin chain->config_bias ?
* in optimizing where config only updates when trial finalized, how to build off new perturbed config in CB?
* Optimize TrialRemove for new_only by not computing interactions with neighbors
* Tunable implementation of configurational bias. When param is 0, rebuilds/renormalizes particles to prevent drift in bond lengths/angles.
* (repeat) regrow but within near existing, for 'free dof, e.g. azimuthal in  angle, sphere in bond, etc'
* Rename Movie->XYZ
* Rename Stepper?
* Patch custom model params not present in mc.configuration().model_params (affects FileXYZPatch).
* early rejection scheme: https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2014.897392
* get rid of 'time' and 'default' values for Random seed argument.
* Windows with non-integer macrostates?
* For unknown reasons, VisitModelOuterCutoff had energy issues with RPM
* Add TrialParticlePivot to TrialGrow (randomly orients particle about site). Or, more generally, say num_steps=-1 combines stages into one.
* better support compressed trajectory formats: xtc, dcd, etc
* Wrap triclinic particles for Movie. See: https://github.com/lammps/lammps/blob/develop/src/domain.cpp#L1232-L1322
* Implement Jeff's parallel method via CollectionMatrixSplice that allows exchange of window ranges with overlapping simulations
* Similarly, implement a non-OMP fh parallelization. Maybe that should be the first example before OMP communication? Only problem, keep windows running until last one converges?
* Update Translate tunable maximum when volume changes..?
* tutorials which segfault on restart dont report errors in automated tests
* Move Trial checks so that they can be applied to GhostTrialGrow
* Make Criteria[Updater,Writer] part of FlatHistogram keywords?
* Restart Prefetch. Does Run::num_trials work properly?
* optimize Ewald::update_wave_vector for NPT (less clear,push_back).
* Reduce size of Checkpoint files for cell/neighbor lists (re-compute instead of checkpointing them). Also large tables.
* Represent relative rigid bodies as screw motion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_theory
* Allow mixing rules input in fstprt files (either as manual input i-j or selection of mixing rules from list, or both).
* Depreciate and update AngleSquareWell::min/max to min_degrees/max_degrees
* Ewald mod k2max like LAMMPS
* Add 1/2 factor in AngleHarmonic
* Add precompute for BondFourBody, ThreeBody, etc, to speed up? But different dihedrals have different coefficients.
* Add option to not serialize neighbor lists to reduce checkpoint size.
* Allow one script to contain multiple MonteCarlo, CollectionMatrixSplice, Prefetch in any order? (checkpointing is difficult)
* When trials start, check to see if there is a trial that uses weight_per_number_fraction but there are fixed particles (or, see if there are weight_per_number for all types unless excluded?)
* Speed up compilation. Try... https://stackoverflow.com/a/373179 .. pimpl, less includes, forward declare, etc. Remove Propertied entities, etc.
* Add a FAQ for sim questions, such as, an overview of various table potential options, etc.
* Optimize BondVisitor that uses deserialize_map and strings in inner loop
* Hard code version into source code releases. Or update README_html to download releases with wget? Release not just tag? Remove -g from compiler flags?
* Compress README features list (table?)
* Add more documentation/examples of analyzing stdev of the mean with block analysis. Output individual block averages for custom analysis? Correlation time? Move Accumulator example to text interface. Expose Accumulator options (stepper takes Accumulator arguments).
* Remove ConvertToRefPotential in v0.26
* Make a macro for mapper/serialization boiler plate
